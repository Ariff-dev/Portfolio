        <p>
            Hi there! I’m a product-focused Software Developer and a final-year Software Engineering student passionate about building technology that solves real problems. My journey into tech began at 15, when I learned Java to build a Minecraft server for my friends — an experience that sparked my curiosity for purposeful, hands-on problem-solving.

            Over the years, I’ve developed a strong foundation in software architecture, databases, and cloud computing through my studies at Hybridge University. I started out in front-end development with React and Angular, and later expanded into back-end and data engineering, where I found my real passion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, I work as a Software Developer & Analyst in the FinTech sector, focusing on PHP-based back-end development, process automation, and data-driven tools that enhance business efficiency. Outside of work, I love experimenting with new technologies, contributing to personal projects, and connecting with others who share a passion for building meaningful software.
